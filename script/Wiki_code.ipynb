'\\nInception is a 2010 science fiction action film[4][5][6] written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced the film with Emma Thomas, his wife. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person\\'s idea into a target\\'s subconscious.[7] The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Elliot Page,[a] Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\\nAfter the 2002 completion of Insomnia, Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment for a horror film envisioning \"dream stealers,\" based on lucid dreaming.[8] Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity, Nolan shelved the project and instead worked on 2005\\'s Batman Begins, 2006\\'s The Prestige, and The Dark Knight in 2008.[9] The treatment was revised over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009.[10] Inception was filmed in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22.[11] Its official budget was $160\\xa0million, split between Warner Bros. and Legendary.[12] Nolan\\'s reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure the film\\'s US$100\\xa0million in advertising expenditure.\\nInception\\'s premiere was held in London on July 8, 2010; it was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters beginning on July 16, 2010.[13][14] Inception grossed over $828\\xa0million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2010. Considered one of the best films of the 2010s,[15] Inception won four Academy Awards (Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects) and was nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Original Score.\\n',\n"," 'Contents': '',\n"," 'Plot': 'Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\"; they perform corporate espionage using experimental dream-sharing technology to infiltrate their targets\\' subconscious and extract information. Their latest target, Saito, is impressed with Cobb\\'s ability to layer multiple dreams within each other and offers to hire Cobb for the supposedly impossible job of implanting an idea into a person\\'s subconscious; performing \"inception\" on Robert, the son of Saito\\'s competitor Maurice Fischer, with the idea to dissolve his father\\'s company. Saito promises to clear Cobb\\'s criminal status, allowing him to return home to his children.\\nCobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: a forger named Eames, a chemist named Yusuf, and a college student named Ariadne. Ariadne is tasked with designing the dream\\'s architecture, something Cobb himself cannot do for fear of being sabotaged by a projection of his late wife Mal. Maurice dies, and the team sedates Robert into a three-layer shared dream on a plane to America. Time on each layer runs slower than the layer above, with one member staying behind on each to perform a music-synchronized \"kick\" to awaken dreamers on all three levels simultaneously.\\nThe team abducts Robert in a city on the first level but is attacked by his subconscious projections. After Saito is wounded, Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally awaken dreamers, Yusuf\\'s sedatives will instead send them into \"Limbo\": a world of infinite subconscious. Eames impersonates Robert\\'s godfather, Peter Browning, to introduce the idea of an alternate will to dissolve the company. Cobb tells Ariadne that he and Mal entered Limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing, experiencing fifty years in one night due to the time dilation with reality. Mal refused to return to reality, and Cobb instead performed inception on her to convince her. After waking up, Mal still believed she was dreaming. Attempting to \"wake up\", she committed suicide and framed Cobb to force him to do the same. Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children behind.\\nYusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that he has been kidnapped by Browning to stop the dissolution and that Cobb is a defensive projection, leading Robert yet another level deeper as part of a ruse to enter Robert\\'s subconscious. In the third level, the team infiltrates an alpine fortress with a projection of Maurice inside, where the inception itself can be performed.  However, Yusuf performs his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, forcing Arthur and Eames to improvise a new set of kicks synchronized with them hitting the water by rigging an elevator and the fortress respectively with explosives. Mal then appears and kills Robert before he can be subjected to the inception and he and Saito are lost into Limbo, forcing Cobb and Ariadne to rescue them in time for Robert\\'s inception and Eames\\'s kick.\\nCobb makes peace with Mal\\'s death. Ariadne kills Mal\\'s projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived into the third level, he discovers the planted idea: his dying father telling him to create something for himself. While Cobb searches for Saito in Limbo, the others ride the kicks back to reality. Cobb finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Arriving at L.A., Cobb passes the immigration checkpoint and his father-in-law accompanies him to his home. Cobb uses Mal\\'s \"totem\" – a top that spins indefinitely in a dream – to test if he is indeed in the real world, but chooses not to observe the result and instead joins his children.\\n',\n"," 'Cast': '',\n"," 'Production': '',\n"," 'Development': 'Initially, Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment about dream-stealers.[8] Originally, Nolan had envisioned Inception as a horror film,[8] but eventually wrote it as a heist film even though he found that \"traditionally [they] are very deliberately superficial in emotional terms.\"[31] Upon revisiting his script, he decided that basing it in that genre did not work because the story \"relies so heavily on the idea of the interior state, the idea of dream and memory. I realized I needed to raise the emotional stakes.\"[31]\\nNolan worked on the script for nine to ten years.[16] When he first started thinking about making the film, Nolan was influenced by \"that era of movies where you had The Matrix (1999), you had Dark City (1998), you had The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and, to a certain extent, you had Memento (2000), too. They were based in the principles that the world around you might not be real.\"[31][32]\\nNolan first pitched the film to Warner Bros. in 2001, but decided that he needed more experience making large-scale films, and embarked on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.[9] He soon realized that a film like Inception needed a large budget because \"as soon as you\\'re talking about dreams, the potential of the human mind is infinite. And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite. It has to feel like you could go anywhere by the end of the film. And it has to work on a massive scale.\"[9] After making The Dark Knight, Nolan decided to make Inception and spent six months completing the script.[9] Nolan said that the key to completing the script was wondering what would happen if several people shared the same dream. \"Once you remove the privacy, you\\'ve created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact, with validity, with weight, with dramatic consequences.\"[33]\\nNolan had been trying to work with Leonardo DiCaprio for years and met him several times, but was unable to recruit him for any of his films until Inception.[27] DiCaprio finally agreed because he was \"intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character\\'s going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life.\"[34]:\\u200a93–94\\u200a He read the script and found it to be \"very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate some of the things that have been swirling around his head for the last eight years.\"[9] DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay. Nolan took a long time re-writing the script in order \"to make sure that the emotional journey of his [DiCaprio\\'s] character was the driving force of the movie.\"[16] On February 11, 2009, it was announced that Warner Bros. purchased Inception, a spec script written by Nolan.[10]\\n',\n"," 'Locations and sets ': 'Principal photography began in Tokyo on June 19, 2009, with the scene in which Saito first hires Cobb during a helicopter flight over the city.[8][19]:\\u200a13\\u200a\\nThe production moved to the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London.[19]:\\u200a14\\u200a There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built.[35]:\\u200a29\\u200a A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360\\xa0degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea was inspired by a technique used in Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Nolan said, \"I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario\".[35]:\\u200a32\\u200a The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40 feet (12\\xa0m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway\\'s length was increased to 100\\xa0ft (30\\xa0m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors.[19]:\\u200a14\\u200a\\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like \"a giant hamster wheel\".[31] Nolan said of the device, \"It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It\\'s unsettling in a wonderful way\".[31] Gordon-Levitt remembered, \"it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don\\'t, you\\'re going to fall.\"[36] On July 15, 2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story,[8] including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.[37]\\nFilming moved to France, where they shot Cobb entering the college of architecture (the place used for the entrance was the Musée Galliera) and the pivotal scenes between Ariadne and Cobb, in a bistro (a fictional one set up at the corner of Rue César Franck and Rue Bouchut), and lastly on the Bir-Hakeim bridge.[19]:\\u200a17\\u200a For the explosion that takes place during the bistro scene, local authorities would not allow the use of real explosives. High-pressure nitrogen was used to create the effect of a series of explosions. Pfister used six high-speed cameras to capture the sequence from different angles and make sure that they got the shot. The visual effects department enhanced the sequence, adding more destruction and flying debris. For the \"Paris folding\" sequence and when Ariadne \"creates\" the bridges, green screen and CGI were used on location.[19]:\\u200a17\\u200a\\nTangier, Morocco, doubled as Mombasa, where Cobb hires Eames and Yusuf. A foot chase was shot in the streets and alleyways of the historic medina quarter.[19]:\\u200a18\\u200a To capture this sequence, Pfister employed a mix of hand-held camera and steadicam work.[19]:\\u200a19\\u200a Tangier was also used as the setting for filming an important riot scene during the initial foray into Saito\\'s mind.\\nFilming moved to the Los Angeles area, where some sets were built on a Warner Bros. sound stage, including the interior rooms of Saito\\'s Japanese castle (the exterior was done on a small set built in Malibu Beach). The dining room was inspired by the historic Nijō Castle, built around 1603. These sets were inspired by a mix of Japanese architecture and Western influences.[19]:\\u200a19\\u200a\\nThe production staged a multi-vehicle car chase on the streets of downtown Los Angeles, which involved a freight train crashing down the middle of a street.[19]:\\u200a20\\u200a To do this, the filmmakers configured a train engine on the chassis of a tractor trailer. The replica was made from fiberglass molds taken from authentic train parts and matched in terms of color and design.[19]:\\u200a21\\u200a Also, the car chase was supposed to be set in the midst of a downpour, but the L.A. weather stayed typically sunny. The filmmakers set up elaborate effects (e.g., rooftop water cannons) to give the audience the impression that the weather was overcast and soggy. L.A. was also the site of the climactic scene where a Ford Econoline van runs off the Schuyler Heim Bridge in slow motion.[38] This sequence was filmed on and off for months, with the van being shot out of a cannon, according to actor Dileep Rao. Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film.\\nOnce the van landed in the water, the challenge for the actors was to avoid panic. \"And when they ask you to act, it\\'s a bit of an ask,\" explained Cillian Murphy.[38] The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air from scuba tanks; underwater buddy breathing is shown in this sequence.[38]\\nCobb\\'s house was in Pasadena. The hotel lobby was filmed at the CAA building in Century City. \\'Limbo\\' was made on location in Los Angeles and Morocco, with the beach scene filmed at Palos Verdes beach with CGI buildings. N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for \\'Limbo,\\' with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.\\nThe final phase of principal photography took place in Alberta in late November 2009. The location manager discovered a temporarily closed ski resort, Fortress Mountain.[19]:\\u200a22\\u200a An elaborate set was assembled near the top station of the Canadian chairlift, taking three months to build.[34]:\\u200a93\\u200a The production had to wait for a huge snowstorm, which eventually arrived.[8] The ski-chase sequence was inspired by Nolan\\'s favorite James Bond film, On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service (1969): \"What I liked about it that we\\'ve tried to emulate in this film is there\\'s a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion.\"[34]:\\u200a91\\u200a\\n',\n"," 'Cinematography': 'The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format on 35\\xa0mm film, with key sequences filmed on 65 mm, and aerial sequences in VistaVision. Nolan did not shoot any footage with IMAX cameras as he had with The Dark Knight. \"We didn\\'t feel that we were going to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible. Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras, even though I love the format dearly\".[16] In addition Nolan and Pfister tested using Showscan and Super Dimension 70 as potential large-format, high-frame-rate camera systems to use for the film, but ultimately decided against either format.[35]:\\u200a29\\u200a Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo-Sonics 35\\xa0mm camera at speeds of up to 1,000 frames per second. Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speed digital camera, but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches. \"Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one usable piece and it didn\\'t end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35\\xa0mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie.\"[39] Nolan also chose not to shoot any of the film in 3D as he prefers shooting on film[16] using prime lenses, which is not possible with 3D cameras.[40] Nolan has also criticized the dim image that 3D projection produces, and disputes that traditional film does not allow realistic depth perception, saying \"I think it\\'s a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D. The whole point of cinematic imagery is it\\'s three dimensional... You know 95% of our depth cues come from occlusion, resolution, color and so forth, so the idea of calling a 2D movie a \\'2D movie\\' is a little misleading.\"[41] Nolan did test converting Inception into 3D in post-production but decided that, while it was possible, he lacked the time to complete the conversion to a standard he was happy with.[8][41] In February 2011 Jonathan Liebesman suggested that Warner Bros. were attempting a 3D conversion for Blu-ray release.[42]\\nWally Pfister gave each location and dream level a distinctive look to aid the audience\\'s recognition of the narrative\\'s location during the heavily crosscut portion of the film: the mountain fortress appears sterile and cool, the hotel hallways have warm hues, and the scenes in the van are more neutral.[35]:\\u200a35–36\\u200a\\nNolan has said that the film \"deals with levels of reality, and perceptions of reality which is something I\\'m very interested in. It\\'s an action film set in a contemporary world, but with a slight science-fiction bent to it,\" while also describing it as \"very much an ensemble film structured somewhat as a heist movie. It\\'s an action adventure that spans the globe\".[43]\\n',\n"," 'Visual effects': 'For dream sequences in Inception, Nolan used little computer-generated imagery, preferring practical effects whenever possible. Nolan said, \"It\\'s always very important to me to do as much as possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics are very useful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically.\"[19]:\\u200a12\\u200a To this end, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin built a miniature of the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film. For the fight scene that takes place in zero gravity, he used CG-based effects to \"subtly bend elements like physics, space and time.\"[44]\\nThe most challenging effect was the \"Limbo\" city level at the end of the film, because it continually developed during production. Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan expressed his ideal vision: \"Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture, but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs\".[44] Franklin and his team ended up with \"something that looked like an iceberg version of Gotham City with water running through it.\"[44] They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct DiCaprio and Page based on this rough computer animation that Franklin had created. Inception had nearly 500 visual effects shots (in comparison, Batman Begins had approximately 620), which is relatively few in comparison to contemporary effects-heavy films, which can have as many as 2,000 visual effects shots.[44]\\n',\n"," 'Music': 'The score for Inception was written by Hans Zimmer,[26] who described his work as \"a very electronic,[45] dense score\",[46] filled with \"nostalgia and sadness\" to match Cobb\\'s feelings throughout the film.[47] The music was written simultaneously to filming,[46] and features a guitar sound reminiscent of Ennio Morricone, played by Johnny Marr, former guitarist of the Smiths.\\nÉdith Piaf\\'s \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (\"No, I Regret Nothing\") appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score.[47]\\nA soundtrack album was released on July 11, 2010, by Reprise Records.[48] The majority of the score was also included in high resolution 5.1 surround sound on the second disc of the two-disc Blu-ray release.[49] Hans Zimmer\\'s music was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Original Score category in 2011, losing to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of The Social Network.[50]\\n',\n"," 'Themes': '',\n"," 'Reality and dreams': 'In Inception, Nolan wanted to explore \"the idea of people sharing a dream space... That gives you the ability to access somebody\\'s unconscious mind. What would that be used and abused for?\"[16] The majority of the film\\'s plot takes place in these interconnected dream worlds. This structure creates a framework where actions in the real or dream worlds ripple across others. The dream is always in a state of production, and shifts across the levels as the characters navigate it.[51] By contrast, the world of The Matrix (1999) is an authoritarian, computer-controlled one, alluding to theories of social control developed by thinkers Michel Foucault and Jean Baudrillard. However, according to one interpretation Nolan\\'s world has more in common with the works of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.[51]\\nDavid Denby in The New Yorker compared Nolan\\'s cinematic treatment of dreams to Luis Buñuel\\'s in Belle de Jour (1967) and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972).[52] He criticized Nolan\\'s \"literal-minded\" action level sequencing compared to Buñuel, who \"silently pushed us into reveries and left us alone to enjoy our wonderment, but Nolan is working on so many levels of representation at once that he has to lay in pages of dialogue just to explain what\\'s going on.\" The latter captures \"the peculiar malign intensity of actual dreams.\"[52]\\nDeirdre Barrett, a dream researcher at Harvard University, said that Nolan did not get every detail accurate regarding dreams, but their illogical, rambling, disjointed plots would not make for a great thriller anyway. However, \"he did get many aspects right,\" she said, citing the scene in which a sleeping Cobb is shoved into a full bath, and in the dream world water gushes into the windows of the building, waking him up. \"That\\'s very much how real stimuli get incorporated, and you very often wake up right after that intrusion.\"[53]\\nNolan himself said, \"I tried to work that idea of manipulation and management of a conscious dream being a skill that these people have. Really the script is based on those common, very basic experiences and concepts, and where can those take you? And the only outlandish idea that the film presents, really, is the existence of a technology that allows you to enter and share the same dream as someone else.\"[31]\\n',\n"," 'Dreams and cinema': 'Others have argued that the film is itself a metaphor for filmmaking, and that the filmgoing experience itself, images flashing before one\\'s eyes in a darkened room, is akin to a dream. Writing in Wired, Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film-watching and sleeping. In both, the visual cortex is highly active and the prefrontal cortex, which deals with logic, deliberate analysis, and self-awareness, is quiet.[54] Paul argued that the experience of going to a picturehouse is itself an exercise in shared dreaming, particularly when viewing Inception: the film\\'s sharp cutting between scenes forces the viewer to create larger narrative arcs to stitch the pieces together. This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, on the part of the audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film\\'s story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another\\'s dream, in this case Nolan\\'s, as with any work of art, one\\'s reading of it is ultimately influenced by one\\'s own subjective desires and subconscious.[51] At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding facing mirrors underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in la Croix asked \"Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?\"[55]\\n',\n"," 'Cinematic technique': '',\n"," 'Genre': 'Nolan combined elements from several different film genres into the film, notably science fiction, heist film, and film noir.\\nMarion Cotillard plays \"Mal\" Cobb, Dom Cobb\\'s projection of his guilt over his deceased wife\\'s suicide. As the film\\'s main antagonist, she is a frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor.[27] Nolan described Mal as \"the essence of the femme fatale\",[19]:\\u200a9\\u200a the key noir reference in the film. As a \"classic femme fatale\" her relationship with Cobb is in his mind, a manifestation of Cobb\\'s own neurosis and fear of how little he knows about the woman he loves.[56] DiCaprio praised Cotillard\\'s performance saying that \"she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character\".[19]:\\u200a10\\u200a\\nNolan began with the structure of a heist movie, since exposition is an essential element of that genre, though adapted it to have a greater emotional narrative suited to the world of dreams and subconscious.[56] As Denby described this device: \"the outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper\".[52] Kristin Thompson argued that exposition was a major formal device in the film. While a traditional heist movie has a heavy dose of exposition at the beginning as the team assembles and the leader explains the plan, in Inception this becomes nearly continuous as the group progresses through the various levels of dreaming.[57] Three quarters of the film, until the van begins to fall from the bridge, are devoted to explaining its plot. In this way, exposition takes precedence over characterization. The characters\\' relationships are created by their respective skills and roles. Ariadne, like her ancient namesake, creates the maze and guides the others through it, but also helps Cobb navigate his own subconscious, and as the sole student of dream sharing, helps the audience understand the concept of the plot.[58]\\nNolan drew inspiration from the works of Jorge Luis Borges,[8][59] including \"The Secret Miracle\" and \"The Circular Ruins\",[60] and from the films Blade Runner (1982) and The Matrix (1999).[60][61] While Nolan has not confirmed this, it has also been suggested by many observers that the movie draws heavy inspiration from the 2006 animated film Paprika.[62][63][64]\\n',\n"," 'Ending': 'The film cuts to the closing credits from a shot of the top apparently starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate,[56] saying, \"I\\'ve been asked the question more times than I\\'ve ever been asked any other question about any other film I\\'ve made... What\\'s funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it.\"[65] The film\\'s script concludes with \"Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we—FADE OUT\".[66] Nolan said, \"I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me—it always felt like the appropriate \\'kick\\' to me... The real point of the scene—and this is what I tell people—is that Cobb isn\\'t looking at the top. He\\'s looking at his kids. He\\'s left it behind. That\\'s the emotional significance of the thing.\"[65] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, \"If I\\'m there it\\'s real, because I\\'m never in the dream. I\\'m the guy who invented the dream.\"[67]\\nMark Fisher argued that \"a century of cultural theory\" cautions against accepting the author\\'s interpretation as anything more than a supplementary text, and this all the more so given the theme of the instability of any one master position in Nolan\\'s films. Therein the manipulator is often the one who ends up manipulated, and Cobb\\'s \"not caring\" about whether or not his world is real may be the price of his happiness and release.[68]\\n',\n"," 'Release': '',\n"," 'Marketing': 'Warner Bros. spent US$100\\xa0million marketing the film. Although Inception was not part of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner\\'s worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of \"Christopher Nolan as a brand\". Kroll declared that \"We don\\'t have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can\\'t make those elements work, it\\'s a sad day.\"[69] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, \"You have this movie which is going to have a pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [Nolan] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans.\"[70]\\nA viral marketing campaign was employed for the film. After the revelation of the first teaser trailer, in August 2009, the film\\'s official website featured only an animation of Cobb\\'s spinning top. In December, the top toppled over and the website opened the online game Mind Crime, which upon completion revealed Inception\\'s poster.[71] The rest of the campaign unrolled after WonderCon in April 2010, where Warner gave away promotional T-shirts featuring the PASIV briefcase used to create the dream space, and had a QR code linking to an online manual of the device.[72] Mind Crime also received a stage\\xa02 with more resources, including a hidden trailer for the movie.[73] More pieces of viral marketing began to surface before Inception\\'s release, such as a manual filled with bizarre images and text sent to Wired magazine,[74] and the online publication of posters, ads, phone applications, and strange websites all related to the film.[75][76] Warner also released an online prequel comic, Inception: The Cobol Job.[77]\\nThe official trailer released on May 10, 2010, through Mind Game was extremely well received.[73] It featured an original piece of music, \"Mind Heist\", by recording artist Zack Hemsey,[78] rather than music from the score.[79] The trailer quickly went viral with numerous mashups copying its style, both by amateurs on sites like YouTube[80] and by professionals on sites such as CollegeHumor.[81][82] On June 7, 2010, a behind-the-scenes featurette on the film was released in HD on Yahoo! Movies.[83]\\nInception and its film trailers are widely credited for launching the trend throughout the 2010s in which blockbuster movie trailers repeatedly hit audiences with so-called \"braam\" sounds: \"bassy, brassy, thunderous notes—like a foghorn on steroids—meant to impart a sense of apocalyptic momentousness\".[84] However, different composers worked on the teaser trailer, first trailer, second trailer, and film score, meaning that identifying the composer(s) responsible for that trend is a complicated task.[84]\\n',\n"," 'Home media': 'Inception was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 3, 2010, in France,[85] and the week after in the UK and USA (December 7, 2010).[86][87] Warner Bros. also made available in the United States a limited Blu-ray edition packaged in a metal replica of the PASIV briefcase, which included extras such as a metal replica of the spinning top totem. With a production run of less than 2,000, it sold out in one weekend.[88] Inception was released on 4K Blu-ray and digital copy along with other Christopher Nolan films on December 19, 2017.[89] As of 2018[update], the home video releases have sold over 9\\xa0million units and grossed over $160 million.[90]\\n',\n"," 'Putative video game': 'In a November 2010 interview, Nolan expressed his intention to develop a video game set in the Inception world, working with a team of collaborators.

It\\'s a breathtaking juggling act.\"[119] Richard Roeper, also of the Sun-Times, gave Inception an \"A+\" score and called it \"one of the best movies of the [21st] century.\"[120] BBC Radio 5 Live\\'s Mark Kermode named Inception as the best film of 2010, stating that \"Inception is proof that people are not stupid, that cinema is not trash, and that it is possible for blockbusters and art to be the same thing.\"[121]\\nMichael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, \"I found myself wishing Inception were weirder, further out [...] the film is Nolan\\'s labyrinth all the way, and it\\'s gratifying to experience a summer movie with large visual ambitions and with nothing more or less on its mind than (as Shakespeare said) a dream that hath no bottom.\"[122] TIME magazine\\'s Richard Corliss wrote that the film\\'s \"noble intent is to implant one man\\'s vision in the mind of a vast audience [...] The idea of moviegoing as communal dreaming is a century old. With Inception, viewers have a chance to see that notion get a state-of-the-art update.\"[123] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt that Nolan was able to blend \"the best of traditional and modern filmmaking. If you\\'re searching for smart and nervy popular entertainment, this is what it looks like.\"[124]\\nUSA Today\\'s Claudia Puig gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and felt that Nolan \"regards his viewers as possibly smarter than they are—or at least as capable of rising to his inventive level. That\\'s a tall order. But it\\'s refreshing to find a director who makes us stretch, even occasionally struggle, to keep up.\"[125]\\nNot all reviewers gave the film positive reviews. New York magazine\\'s David Edelstein claimed in his review that he had \"no idea what so many people are raving about. It\\'s as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself.\"[126] The New York Observer\\'s Rex Reed explained that the film\\'s development was \"pretty much what we\\'ve come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... [it] doesn\\'t seem like much of an accomplishment to me.\"[127] A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented \"there is a lot to see in Inception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan\\'s idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, and too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness.\"[128] The New Yorker\\'s David Denby considered the film to \"not nearly [be] as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be\", concluding that \"Inception is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else.\"[52]\\nWhile some critics have tended to view the film as perfectly straightforward, and even criticize its overarching themes as \"the stuff of torpid platitudes,\" online discussion has been much more positive.[129] Heated debate has centered on the ambiguity of the ending, with many critics like Devin Faraci making the case that the film is self-referential and tongue-in-cheek, both a film about film-making and a dream about dreams.[130] Other critics read Inception as Christian allegory and focus on the film\\'s use of religious and water symbolism.[131] Yet other critics, such as Kristin Thompson, see less value in the ambiguous ending of the film and more in its structure and novel method of storytelling, highlighting Inception as a new form of narrative that revels in \"continuous exposition\".[57]\\nSeveral critics and scholars have noted the film has many striking similarities to the 2006 anime film Paprika by Satoshi Kon (and Yasutaka Tsutsui\\'s 1993 novel of the same name), including plot similarities, similar scenes, and similar characters, arguing that Inception was influenced by Paprika.[62][63][64][132][133] Several sources have also noted plot similarities between the film and the 2002 Uncle Scrooge comic The Dream of a Lifetime by Don Rosa.[134][135][136] The influence of Tarkovsky\\'s Solaris on Inception was noted as well.[137][138]\\n',\n"," 'Year-end and all-time lists': 'Inception appeared on over 273 critics\\' lists of the top ten films of 2010, being picked as number-one on at least 55 of those lists.[139] It was the second-most-mentioned film in both the top ten lists and number-one rankings, only behind The Social Network along with Toy Story 3, True Grit, The King\\'s Speech, and Black Swan as the most critically acclaimed films of 2010.[139] Author Stephen King placed Inception at #3 in his list of top 10 best movies of the year.[140]\\nCritics and publications who ranked the film first for that year included Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times (tied with The Social Network and Toy Story 3), Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club, Empire magazine, and Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter.[141]\\nIn March 2011, the film was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their ninth-favorite film of all time.[142] Producer Roger Corman cited Inception as an example of \"great imagination and originality\".[143] It was voted as the third-best science fiction film of all time in the 2011 list Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time, based on a poll conducted by ABC and People.[citation needed] In 2012, Inception was ranked the 35th-best-edited film of all time by the Motion Picture Editors Guild.[144] In the same year, Total Film named it the most-rewatchable movie of all time.[145] In 2014, Empire ranked Inception the tenth-greatest film ever made on their list of \"The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time\" as voted by the magazine\\'s readers,[146] while Rolling Stone magazine named it the second-best science fiction film since the turn of the century.[147] Inception was ranked 84th on Hollywood\\'s 100 Favorite Films, a list compiled by The Hollywood Reporter in 2014, surveying \"Studio chiefs, Oscar winners and TV royalty\".[148] In 2016, Inception was voted the 51st-best film of the 21st Century by BBC, as picked by 177 film critics from around the world.[149] The film was included in the Visual Effects Society\\'s list of \"The Most Influential Visual Effects Films of All Time\".[150] In 2019, Total Film named Inception the best film of the 2010s.[151] Many critics and media outlets included Inception in their rankings of the best films of the 2010s.[152][153][154][155][156][157] The film was included in Forbes magazine\\'s list of Top 150 Greatest Films of 21st Century.[158]\\nIn April 2014, The Daily Telegraph placed the title on its top ten list of the most overrated films. Telegraph\\'s Tim Robey stated, \"It\\'s a criminal failing of the movie that it purports to be about people\\'s dreams being invaded, but demonstrates no instinct at all for what a dream has ever felt like, and no flair for making us feel like we\\'re in one, at any point.\"[159] The film won an informal poll by the Los Angeles Times as the most overrated movie of 2010.[160]\\n',\n"," 'Accolades': \"The film won many awards in technical categories, such as Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects,[50] and the British Academy Film Awards for Best Production Design, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound.[161] In most of its artistic nominations, such as Film, Director, and Screenplay at the Oscars, BAFTAs and Golden Globes, the film was defeated by The Social Network or The King's Speech.[50][161][162] However, the film did win the two highest honors for a science fiction or fantasy film: the 2011 Bradbury Award for best dramatic production[163] and the 2011 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form).[164]\\n\",\n"," 'In popular culture': 'Numerous pop and hip hop songs reference the film, including Common\\'s \"Blue Sky,\" N.E.R.D.\\'s \"Hypnotize U,\" XV\\'s \"The Kick,\" Black Eyed Peas\\' \"Just Can\\'t Get Enough,\" Lil Wayne\\'s \"6 Foot 7 Foot,\" Jennifer Lopez\\'s \"On the Floor,\" and B.o.B\\'s \"Strange Clouds,\" while T.I. had Inception-based artwork on two of his mixtapes. An instrumental track by Joe Budden is titled \"Inception.\"[165] The animated series South Park parodies the film in the show\\'s tenth episode of its fourteenth season, titled \"Insheeption.\"[166] The film was also an influence for Ariana Grande\\'s video for \"No Tears Left to Cry.\"[167] \"Lawnmower Dog\", the second episode of the animated comedy show Rick and Morty, parodied the film.[168] In an episode of The Simpsons, named \"How I Wet Your Mother\", the plot spoofs Inception with various scenes parodying moments from the film.[169] The showrunners of the television series The Flash said its season 4 finale was inspired by Inception.[170] In February 2020, American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift released a lyric video for her single \"The Man\", which featured visuals bearing resemblance to the film. The song also mentions DiCaprio in its lyrics.[171]\\nThe film\\'s title has been colloquialized as the suffix -ception, which can be jokingly appended to a noun to indicate a layering, nesting, or recursion of the thing in question.[172]\\n',\n"," 'See also': '',\n"," 'Notes': '',\n"," 'References': '',\n"," 'Further reading': '',\n"," 'External links': '',\n"," 'Navigation menu': '',\n"," '\\nPersonal tools\\n': '',\n"," '\\nNamespaces\\n': '',\n"," '\\nViews\\n': '',\n"," '\\nSearch\\n': '',\n"," '\\nNavigation\\n': '',\n"," '\\nContribute\\n': '',\n"," '\\nTools\\n': '',\n"," '\\nPrint/export\\n': '',\n"," '\\nIn other projects\\n': '',\n"," '\\nLanguages\\n': ''}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#### build a table\n","d = {'categories': objs.keys, 'values': objs.values}\n","pd.DataFrame(objs,index=['Inception'])"],"metadata":{"id":"ZbBmCPeBb2t6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":296},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668465133267,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":165,"user":{"displayName":"Junzhuo Gu","userId":"04629791665785340511"}},"outputId":"02b492ca-edca-42e1-d9ce-3d5d78b773e5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   Inception Contents  \\\n","Inception  \\nInception is a 2010 science fiction action f...            \n","\n","                                                        Plot Cast Production  \\\n","Inception  Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\";
